Minions debuted in London on June 11, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 10. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it was a solid success at the box office earning $1.159 billion worldwide, and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2015, the 10th-highest-grossing film of all time, and the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time during its theatrical run. A sequel, Minions: The Rise of Gru, is scheduled to be released in July 2022.

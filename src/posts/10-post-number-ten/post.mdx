Gatsby is an open-source framework that combines functionality from React, 
GraphQL and Webpack into a single tool for building static websites and apps. 
Owing to the fast performance of the sites it powers, 
impressive out-of-the-box features like code splitting, 
and friendly developer experience, Gatsby is fast becoming a staple of modern web development.

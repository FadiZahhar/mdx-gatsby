**WALL-E** (stylized with an interpunct as WALLÂ·E) is a 2008 American computer-animated science fiction film[4] produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, and co-written by Jim Reardon. It stars the voices of Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver, with Fred Willard in the film's (and Pixar's) only prominent live-action role. The overall ninth feature film produced by the company, WALL-E follows a solitary robot on a future, uninhabitable, deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship Axiom, a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.

After directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film incorporates various topics including consumerism, corporatocracy, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk.[5] It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.

**WALL-E** was released in the United States on June 27, 2008. 
The film was critically praised for its animation, story, voice acting, characters, visuals, score, use of minimal dialogue, and scenes of romance.
It was also commercially successful, grossing $521.3 million worldwide over a $180 million budget. 
It won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, 
the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Long Form Dramatic Presentation,
the final Nebula Award for Best Script,
the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature with five nominations. It is considered by many critics as the best film of 2008, [10][11] and to be among the best animated films ever made.[12][13][14] The film topped Time's list of the "Best Movies of the Decade",[15] and in 2016 was voted 29th among 100 films considered the best of the 21st century by 117 film critics from around the world.

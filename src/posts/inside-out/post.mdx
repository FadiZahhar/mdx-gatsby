Inside Out is a 2015 American computer-animated film directed by Pete Docter, who wrote the script with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley. It stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan. The film follows five personified emotions: Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black), and Disgust (Kaling). Inside the mind, they lead a young girl named Riley (Dias) through life as she and her parents (Lane and MacLachlan) adjust to their new surroundings after moving from Minnesota to San Francisco.

Docter conceived Inside Out in late 2009 after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. Based on Docter and Ronnie del Carmen's remembrances, the emotions were repurposed for use in the film. During production, the filmmakers consulted psychologists in order to achieve greater accuracy in their portrayal of the mind. Development on Inside Out lasted for five and a half years, on an approximate $175 million budget, and the film faced production difficulties, including story changes.

Inside Out debuted out of competition at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 19. It was well-received by the media for its craftsmanship, screenplay, subject matter, plot, and vocal performances (particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Kind, and Black). Organizations like the National Board of Review and American Film Institute named Inside Out as one of the top 10 films of 2015. It earned $858.8 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015. Inside Out led the 88th Academy Awards season with two nominations (winning one), and received numerous accolades.
